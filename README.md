Well, I kind of set the bar high by renaming this repository to "sbmkit", but what it really is a collection of helper functions for my own research.

What might be of interest to others is Python implementations of the semidefinite relaxation of the SBM from Amini and Levina (2016) and Cai and Li (2015).

Use at your own risk :).
